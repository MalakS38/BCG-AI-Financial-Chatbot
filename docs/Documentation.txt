# AI Financial Chatbot Prototype – Documentation



This AI-powered chatbot is designed to answer predefined financial queries using real-world company data from Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple.

The chatbot retrieves financial data and presents insights in a simple, conversational way.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:

- Analyze financial data from SEC filings
- Provide fast, accurate answers to financial questions
- Demonstrate how AI concepts can be applied in financial consulting

## Supported Queries

Users can ask about:

- Total Revenue
- Net Income
- Debt Ratio
- Operating Cash Flow
- Revenue Growth (%)
- Net Income Growth (%)
- Asset Growth (%)
- Operating Cash Flow Growth (%)


# Example Questions:


“What was Microsoft’s operating cash flow in 2024?”

“Tesla cash flow 2023?”

“Apple cash flow from operations?”

“Did Tesla’s profit increase last year?”

“Show Microsoft’s profit change.”

“What’s the change in Apple’s net income?”

        


#  How It Works:

The chatbot loads the analyzed financial data using pandas.

It then identifies the company and year mentioned in the query or defaulting to the most recent year if year is not specified.

Using conditional (if-elif) statements, it maps user’s query to the appropriate function and returns the result.

# Current Limitations

- The chatbot uses rule-based logic (not NLP yet)
- It supports predefined types of questions
- Live SEC data is not connected yet
